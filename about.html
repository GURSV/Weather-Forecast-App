        <h2>Why we need this app?</h2>
        <p>A weather forecast app is indispensable in our daily lives, serving as a vital tool for planning various activities and ensuring personal safety. It provides detailed and specific information about upcoming weather conditions, enabling individuals to plan their schedules accordingly.
            <br><br>
            Crucially, a weather forecast app plays a pivotal role in safety and preparedness. By providing advance notice of severe weather conditions such as storms, hurricanes, or extreme temperatures, it allows individuals and communities to take necessary precautions. 
            <br><br>
            In the realm of agriculture, farmers heavily rely on weather forecasts to optimize their crop management strategies. Knowing the expected weather conditions aids in planning planting and harvesting schedules, making informed decisions about irrigation, and safeguarding crops against adverse weather events that could significantly impact yields.
            <br><br>
            Similarly, in construction and outdoor work, where activities are highly contingent on weather conditions, a weather forecast app becomes an essential asset. Contractors and workers depend on accurate forecasts to plan and schedule tasks, ensuring optimal working conditions and, more importantly, the safety of individuals involved.
