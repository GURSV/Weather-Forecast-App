    <h1>Climate Change</h1>
    <br>
    <div class="info_1">
        <h3>Major Causes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Greenhouse Gas Emissions</li>
            <li>Deforestation</li>
            <li>Industrial Activities</li>
            <li>Agricultural Practices</li>
            <li>Waste Management</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Effects</h3>
        <p>Climate change has profound and multifaceted effects on the Earth's ecosystems, weather patterns, and human societies. One of the most evident impacts is the increase in global temperatures, leading to more frequent and intense heatwaves. Rising temperatures contribute to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, resulting in sea-level rise, which poses a significant threat to coastal communities and low-lying areas.
            <br><br>
            Changes in precipitation patterns are another consequence of climate change, leading to more frequent and severe weather events. This includes an increase in the frequency and intensity of storms, hurricanes, and heavy rainfall, contributing to flooding and landslides. Conversely, certain regions may experience prolonged droughts, negatively impacting water availability, agriculture, and ecosystems.
            <br><br>
            Ocean acidification, caused by the absorption of excess carbon dioxide by the world's oceans, poses a threat to marine life, particularly to organisms that rely on calcium carbonate for their shells and skeletons, such as corals and mollusks. This jeopardizes marine ecosystems, affecting fisheries and the livelihoods of communities dependent on ocean resources.
            <br><br>
            Climate change also influences biodiversity, as species may struggle to adapt or migrate to more suitable habitats. This can lead to shifts in ecosystems, affecting the balance of species and disrupting ecological relationships. Additionally, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can alter the distribution and behavior of disease vectors, impacting the spread of vector-borne diseases.
            <br><br>
            Human societies face a range of challenges as a result of climate change, including threats to food security, increased frequency of extreme weather events leading to displacement and loss of homes, and economic disruptions due to the vulnerability of industries such as agriculture and tourism to changing climate conditions.
            <br><br>
            In summary, climate change manifests through a complex web of interconnected effects, encompassing shifts in temperature, precipitation patterns, sea levels, and ecosystems. Addressing these challenges requires global cooperation to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to unavoidable changes, and build resilience in the face of a rapidly changing climate.</p>

        <h3>Tips for climate change</h3>
        <p> <ul><li>
                To tackle climate change, individuals can reduce their carbon footprint by embracing energy-efficient practices at home, supporting renewable energy sources, and opting for sustainable transportation. 
            </li>
            <br><br> 
            <li>Conserving water, adopting sustainable agriculture practices, and minimizing waste through recycling and reuse also contribute significantly. Engaging in political advocacy for climate-friendly policies, promoting educational initiatives, and building community awareness are vital steps.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
                Additionally, preparing for climate impacts by supporting climate-resilient infrastructure and maintaining emergency preparedness helps enhance overall climate resilience. Collectively, these actions contribute to a more sustainable and climate-conscious lifestyle.</li></ul></p>
